Thanks for reviewing this. I had particular trouble getting the headerview to render. I tried creating a header view and then programmatically loading it in using tableView headerForSection but I couldn't resize the header, it was always the same height even when I would change the frame size of the header. I'm sure it's something with xcode that I don't understand but I could not figure it out. Any help would be awesome.

Completed: all required sections

Time taken: 12-14 hours.
